# childcare schedule 

Here's an outline of our childcare needs starting this May (2021).

## July and August

Except for occasional holidays, from July 5 through August 25 we are looking for:
  * on weekdays M,T,Th,F
  * pickup V&V at Pine Village in Kendall at 3:30
  * playgrounds, snack, miscellaneous activities until 6pm
  * finishing at our house on Hurley St in East Cambridge

## Before July

Vera's Montessori ends June 3; Virgil's ends June 18.  Until Pine Village starts on 5 July, there will be some days where both Julia and I work and so we could use all-day (6-8 hours) care for one or two kids.  These days are:

  * 7,8,10,28,29 June
  * 1 July

There are other days besides these when we could use 6-8 hours help:
  * 28 May
  * 7,8,9,11 June
  * 2 July

We can be flexible about duration and start times of these sessions, but they should include the range 10am-6pm.

## Late August

Pine Village closes the last week of August, and we could use some all-day care then (precise dates TBD).

## September onward

V&V return to their Montessoris in central square.  At this point, we will need:
- on weekdays of M,T,Th,F
- 3pm pickup for Vera and 330 pickup for Virgil
- care until finish at 6 on Hurley St
Logistics TBD.
